@desc The universal access menu is the icon on the top bar that looks like
      a person.

The $em(universal access menu) is where you can turn on some of the
accessibility settings. You can find this menu by clicking the icon which
looks like a person surrounded by a circle on the top bar.

If you do not see the universal access menu, you can enable it from the
$gui(Universal Access) settings panel:

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Universal Access).

* Click on $gui(Universal Access) to open the panel.

* Switch $gui(Always Show Universal Access Menu) to $gui(ON).

To access this menu using the keyboard rather than the mouse, press
$keyseq($key(Ctrl)$key(Alt)$key(Tab)) to move the
keyboard focus to the top bar. A white line will appear underneath the
$gui(Activities) button â€” this tells you which item on the top bar is
selected. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the white line under the
universal access menu icon and then press $key(Enter) to open it. You
can use the up and down arrow keys to select items in the menu. Press
$key(Enter) to toggle the selected item.
