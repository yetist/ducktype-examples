@desc The screen resolution may be set incorrectly.

This can happen because the display resolution that you have set it is not
the right one for your screen.

To solve this, open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Displays).
Click on $gui(Displays) to open the panel. Try some of the $gui(Resolution)
options and set the one that makes the screen look better.

  Would like a little more explanation on native resolution, which
  is generally only applicable on LCDs. There's a stub for using two
  monitors. Link from section below when it's added.

== When multiple displays are connected
   [#multihead]

If you have two displays connected to the computer (for example, a normal
monitor and a projector), the displays might have different resolutions.
However, the computerâ€™s graphics card can only display the screen in one
resolution at a time, so at least one of the displays might look fuzzy.

You can set it so that the two displays have different resolutions, but
you will not be able to display the same thing on both screens
simultaneously. In effect, you will have two independent screens connected at
the same time. You can move windows from one screen to another, but you
cannot show the same window on both screens at once.

To set up the displays so that they each have their own resolution:

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Displays).

* Click on $gui(Displays) to open the panel.

* The displays should be listed as $gui(Mirrored). Select your main display.

* Select $gui(Primary) in the list of display configurations, and then click
  $gui[.button](Apply) to save.

* Select each display in turn from the gray box at the top of the
  $gui(Displays) window. Change the $gui(Resolution) until that
  display looks right.
