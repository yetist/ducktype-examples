@desc Follow these tips if you canâ€™t find a file you created or
      downloaded.

If you created or downloaded a file, but now you cannot find it, follow
these tips.

* If you do not remember where you saved the file, but you have some
  idea of how you named it, you can $link[>files-search](search for the
  file by name).

* If you just downloaded the file, your web browser might
  have automatically saved it to a common folder. Check the
  $file(Desktop) and $file(Downloads) folders in your home
  folder.

* You might have accidentally deleted the file. When you delete
  a file, it gets moved to the trash, where it stays until you manually
  empty the trash. See $link[>files-recover] to learn how to
  recover a deleted file.

* You might have renamed the file in a way that made the file hidden.
  Files that start with a $file(.) or end with a $file(~) are
  hidden in the file manager. Click the
  [-] FIXME: Get a tooltip added for "View options"
  view options button in the $app(Files) toolbar and enable $gui(Show
  Hidden Files) to display them. See $link[>files-hidden] to learn more.
