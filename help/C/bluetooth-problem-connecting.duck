@desc The adapter could be turned off or may not have drivers, or Bluetooth
      might be disabled or blocked.

There are a number of reasons why you may not be able to connect to a
Bluetooth device, such as a phone or headset.

[terms]
- Connection blocked or untrusted
* Some Bluetooth devices block connections by default, or require you to
  change a setting to allow connections to be made. Make sure that your
  device is set up to allow connections.

- Bluetooth hardware not recognized
* Your Bluetooth adapter or dongle may not have been recognized by the
  computer. This could be because
  $link[>hardware-driver](drivers) for the adapter are not
  installed. Some Bluetooth adapters are not supported on Linux, so you may
  not be able to get the right drivers for them. In this case, you will
  probably have to get a different Bluetooth adapter.

- Adapter is not switched on

  [if:choose]
    [if:when test="platform:unity"]
      Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Click the
      Bluetooth icon in the $gui(menu bar) and check that itâ€™s not
      $link[>bluetooth-turn-on-off](disabled).

    Make sure that your Bluetooth adapter is switched on. Open the
    Bluetooth panel and check that it is not
    $link[>bluetooth-turn-on-off](disabled).

- Device Bluetooth connection switched off
* Check that Bluetooth is turned on on the device you are trying to
  connect to, and that it is $link[>bluetooth-visibility](discoverable
  or visible). For example, if you are trying to connect to a phone,
  make sure that it is not in airplane mode.

- No Bluetooth adapter in your computer
* Many computers do not have Bluetooth adapters. You can buy an adapter
  if you want to use Bluetooth.

  Add link to shell-terminology definition of system status *area* of top
  bar when it has been written, explain that if your network connection is
  through a Bluetooth device it will show up in the system status *menu*.
