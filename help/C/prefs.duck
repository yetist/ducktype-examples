  Add an "Applications" guide, with links to net-default-browser, net-default-email,
  files-autorun, and files-open#default. Add pages for "Calendar", "Music", "Video",
  and "Photos". Explain how these are different than options in files-autorun. Link
  between pages. Add notes to files-open-#default about how you can use these options
  to quick set for a group of content types.

  Note Removable Media was moved into System Info for 3.4. This might have involved
  a reorg of the options. Double-check everything before writing for 3.4.
