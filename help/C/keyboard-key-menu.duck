@desc The $key(Menu) key launches a context menu with the keyboard
      rather than with a right-click.

The $key(Menu) key, also known as the $em(Application) key, is a
key found on some Windows-oriented keyboards. This key is usually on the
bottom-right of the keyboard, next to the $key(Ctrl) key, but it can be
placed in a different location by keyboard manufacturers. Its is usually
depicted as a cursor hovering above a menu: $media[its:translate=no image

The primary function of this key is to launch a context menu with the
keyboard rather than by clicking the right mouse button: this is useful if
mouse or a similar device is not available, or when the right mouse button is
not present.

The $key(Menu) key is sometimes omitted in the interest of space,
particularly on portable and laptop keyboards. In this case, some keyboards
include a $key(Menu) function key that can be activated in combination
with the Function ($key(Fn)) key.

The $em(context menu) is a menu that pops up when you right-click. The
menu that you see, if any, is dependent on the context and function of the
area that you right-clicked. When you use the $key(Menu) key, the
context menu is shown for the area of the screen that your cursor is over at
the point when the key is pressed.
