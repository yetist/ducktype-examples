  The controls for sharing with specific networks, under the Networks
  section needs to be explained, perhaps as a separate page.

  Networks section added without explanatory details.

You can let other people view and control your desktop from another
computer with a desktop viewing application. Configure $gui(Screen
Sharing) to allow others to access your desktop and set the security
preferences.

[note .info .package]
  You must have the $app(Vino) package installed for
  $gui(Screen Sharing) to be visible.

  [if:choose]
    [if:when test="action:install"]
      $link[action="install:vino" .button](Install Vino)

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Sharing).

* Click on $gui(Sharing) to open the panel.

* If $gui(Sharing) is $gui(OFF), switch it to $gui(ON).

  [note .info]
  If the text below $gui(Computer Name) allows
  you to edit it, you can $link[>sharing-displayname](change)
  the name your computer displays on the network.

* Select $gui(Screen Sharing).

* To let others view your desktop, switch $gui(Screen Sharing) to
  $gui(ON). This means that other people will be able to attempt to
  connect to your computer and view whatâ€™s on your screen.

* To let others interact with your desktop, switch
  $gui(Allow Remote Control) to $gui(ON). This may allow the
  other person to move your mouse, run applications, and browse files on
  your computer, depending on the security settings which you are currently
  using.

  [note .tip]
    This option is enabled by default when $gui(Screen Sharing) is
    $gui(ON).


== Security
   [#security]

It is important that you consider the full extent of what each security
option means before changing it.

[terms]
- New connections must ask for access
* If you want to be able to choose whether to allow someone to access
  your desktop, enable $gui(New connections must ask for access).  If
  you disable this option, you will not be asked whether you want to allow
  someone to connect to your computer.

  [note .tip]
  This option is enabled by default.

- Require a Password
* To require other people to use a password when connecting to your
  desktop, enable $gui(Require a Password). If you do not use this
  option, anyone can attempt to view your desktop.

  [note .tip]
  This option is disabled by default, but you should enable it and set
  a secure password.

[--
TODO: check whether this option exists.
- Allow access to your desktop over the Internet
* If your router supports UPnP Internet Gateway Device Protocol and it
  is enabled, you can allow other people who are not on your local network
  to view your desktop. To allow this, select $gui(Automatically configure
  UPnP router to open and forward ports). Alternatively, you can
  configure your router manually.

  [note .tip]
  This option is disabled by default.

== Networks
   [#networks]

The $gui(Networks) section lists the networks to which you are
currently connected. Use the $gui(ON | OFF) switch next to each to
choose where your desktop can be shared.


== Stop sharing your desktop
   [#notification-icon]

You can disconnect someone who is viewing your desktop using the
$gui(notification icon) in the message Tray. To do so:

[steps]
* Open the message tray by pressing $keyseq($key(Super)$key(M)),
  or by moving your mouse pointer to the very bottom of your screen.

* Click on the $gui(Desktop) icon in the
  $gui(Message Tray). This will open the $app(Sharing) panel.

* Select $gui(Screen Sharing).

* Toggle the $gui(Screen Sharing) slider to $gui(Off).
