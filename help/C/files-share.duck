  If we get gnome-user-share integrated eventually, we should discuss
  or link that here.

  All functionality except email removed for 3.8 per Bug 680983.

You can easily share files with your contacts by email directly from the
file manager.

[note .important]
  Before you begin, make sure $app(Evolution) or $app(Geary) is
  installed on your computer, and your email account is configured.

[steps]
. To share a file by email:

* Open the $app(Files) application from the $Activities; overview.

* Locate the file you want to transfer.

* Right-click the file and select $gui(Send toâ€¦). An email compose
  window will appear with the file attached.

* Click $gui(To) to choose a contact, or enter an email address
  where you want to send the file. Fill in the $gui(Subject) and the body
  of the message as required and click $gui(Send).

[note .tip]
  You can send multiple files at once. Select multiple files by holding
  down $key(Ctrl) while clicking the files, then right-click any selected
  file.
