@desc Locate files based on file name and type.

You can search for files based on their name or file type directly
within the file manager.

[links topic .linklist]

  This is an extension point where search apps can add
  their own topics. It's empty by default.
--]

[steps]
. Search
* Open the $app(Files) application from the $Activities; overview.

* If you know the files you want are under a particular folder, go to
      that folder.

* Type a word or words that you know appear in the file name, and they
  will be shown in the search bar. For example, if you name all your
  invoices with the word “Invoice”, type $input(invoice). Words are
  matched regardless of case.

  [note]
    Instead of typing words directly to bring up the search bar, you
    can click the magnifying glass in the toolbar, or press
    $keyseq($key(Ctrl)$key(F)).

  You can narrow your results by location and file type.

  * Click $gui(Home) to restrict the search results to your $file(Home)
    folder, or $gui(All Files) to search everywhere.

  * Click the $gui(+) button and pick a $gui(File Type) from the
    drop-down list to narrow the search results based on file type.
    Click the $gui(×) button to remove this option and widen the
    search results.

* You can open, copy, delete, or otherwise work with your files from the
  search results, just as you would from any folder in the file
  manager.

* Click the magnifying glass in the toolbar again to exit the search and
  return to the folder.
