@desc Manage and organize files with the file manager.

[comment]
  This page is a feature overview. There should be a greater visual
  separation between features. Small illustrative figures should be used
  to display these features where appropriate, and video demonstrations of
  some of the features might be useful too. Explain how you can add things to
  the sidebar (link to a topic or explain it here).

Use the $app(Files) file manager to browse and organize the files on your
computer. You can also use it to manage files on storage devices (like
external hard disks), on $link[>nautilus-connect](file servers), and
on network shares.

To start the file manager, open $app(Files) in the $Activities; overview.
You can also search for files and folders through the overview in the same
way you would $link[>shell-apps-open](search for applications).


== Exploring the contents of folders
   [#files-view-folder-contents]

In the file manager, double-click any folder to view its contents, and
double-click or $link[>mouse-middleclick](middle-click) any file to
open it with the default application for that file. Middle-click a folder to
open it in a new tab. You can also right-click a folder to open it in a new tab
or new window.

When looking through the files in a folder, you can quickly
$link[>files-preview](preview each file) by pressing the space bar to be
sure you have the right file before opening it, copying it, or deleting it.

The $em(path bar) above the list of files and folders shows you which
folder youâ€™re viewing, including the parent folders of the current folder.
Click a parent folder in the path bar to go to that folder. Right-click any
folder in the path bar to open it in a new tab or window, or access its
properties.

If you want to quickly $link[>files-search](search for a file), in or below
the folder you are viewing, start typing its name. A $em(search bar) will
appear at the top of the window and only files which match your search will
be shown. Press $key(Esc) to cancel the search.

You can quickly access common places from the $em(sidebar). If you do not
see the sidebar, click $gui(Files) in the top bar and then select $gui(Sidebar).
You can add bookmarks to folders that you use often and they will appear in the
sidebar. Drag a folder to the sidebar, and drop it over $gui(New bookmark),
which appears dynamically, or click the window menu and then select
$gui[.menuitem](Bookmark this Location).
