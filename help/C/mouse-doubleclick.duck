@desc Control how quickly you need to press the mouse button
      a second time to double-click.

Double-clicking only happens when you press the mouse button twice
quickly enough. If the second press is too long after the first, youâ€™ll
just get two separate clicks, not a double click. If you have difficulty
pressing the mouse button quickly, you should increase the timeout.

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Universal Access).

* Click on $gui(Universal Access) to open the panel.

* Under $gui(Pointing & Clicking), adjust the $gui(Double-click)
  slider to a value you find comfortable.

If your mouse double-clicks when you want it to single-click
even though you have increased the double-click timeout,
your mouse may be faulty. Try plugging a different mouse into your computer
and see if that works properly. Alternatively, plug your mouse into a
different computer and see if it still has the same problem.

[note]
This setting will affect both your mouse and touchpad,
as well as any other pointing device.
