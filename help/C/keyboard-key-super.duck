@desc The $key(Super) key opens the $gui(Activities) overview.
      You can usually find it next to the $key(Alt) key on your
      keyboard.

When you press the $key(Super) key, the $gui(Activities)
overview is displayed. This key can usually be found on the bottom-left of
your keyboard, next to the $key(Alt) key, and usually has a Windows logo
on it. It is sometimes called the $em(Windows key) or system key.

[note]
If you have an Apple keyboard, you will have a $key(âŒ˜) (Command)
key instead of the Windows key, while Chromebooks have a magnifying glass
instead.

To change which key is used to display the $gui(Activities) overview:

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview, then open the $app(Settings).

* Click $gui(Keyboard).

* Click the $gui[.tab](Shortcuts) tab.

* Select $gui(System) on the left side of the window, and
  $gui(Show the activities overview) on the right.

* Hold down the desired key combination.
