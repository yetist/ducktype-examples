@desc Use the supplied test profiles to check that your profiles are being
      applied correctly to your screen.

The effects of a color profile are sometimes subtle and it may be hard to
see if anything much has changed.

GNOME comes with several profiles for testing that make it very clear when
the profiles are being applied:

[terms]
- Blue
* This will turn the screen blue and tests if the calibration curves are
  being sent to the display.
[--
    <item>
      <title>ADOBEGAMMA-test</title>
      <p>This will turn the screen pink and tests different features of a
      screen profile.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
      <title>FakeBRG</title>
      <p>This will not change the screen, but will swap around the RGB channels
      to become BGR. This will make all the colors gradients look mostly
      correct, and there wonâ€™t be much difference on the whole screen, but
      images will look very different in applications that support color
      management.</p>
    </item>

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Color).

* Click on $gui(Color) to open the panel.

* Select the device for which you want to add a profile. You may wish
  to make a note of which profile is currently being used.

* Click $gui(Add profile) to select a test profile, which should be
  at the bottom of the list.

* Press $gui(Add) to confirm your selection.

* To revert to your previous profile, select the device in the
  $gui(Color) panel, then select the profile that you were using
  before you tried one of the test profiles and press $gui(Enable)
  to use it again.

Using these profiles, you can clearly see when an application supports
color management.
