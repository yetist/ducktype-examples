@desc You might have low signal, or the network might not be letting
      you connect properly.

You may find that you have been disconnected from a wireless network even
though you wanted to stay connected. Your computer will normally try to
reconnect to the network as soon as this happens (the network icon on the top
bar will display three dots if it is trying to reconnect), but it can be
annoying, especially if you were using the internet at the time.


== Weak wireless signal
   [#signal]

A common reason for being disconnected from a wireless network is that you
have low signal. Wireless networks have a limited range, so if you are too far
away from the wireless base station you may not be able to get a strong enough
signal to maintain a connection. Walls and other objects between you and the
base station can also weaken the signal.

The network icon on the top bar displays how strong your wireless signal is.
If the signal looks low, try moving closer to the wireless base station.


== Network connection not being established properly
   [#network]

Sometimes, when you connect to a wireless network, it may appear that you
have successfully connected at first, but then you will be disconnected soon
after. This normally happens because your computer was only partially
successful in connecting to the network â€” it managed to establish a connection,
but was unable to finalize the connection for some reason and so was
disconnected.

A possible reason for this is that you entered the wrong wireless
passphrase, or that your computer was not allowed on the network (because the
network requires a username to log in, for example).


== Unreliable wireless hardware/drivers
   [#hardware]

Some wireless network hardware can be a little unreliable. Wireless
networks are complicated, so wireless cards and base stations occasionally run
into minor problems and may drop connections. This is annoying, but it happens
quite regularly with many devices. If you are disconnected from wireless
connections from time to time, this may be the only reason. If it happens very
regularly, you may want to consider getting some different hardware.


== Busy wireless networks
   [#busy]

Wireless networks in busy places (in universities and coffee shops, for
example) often have many computers trying to connect to them at once. Sometimes
these networks get too busy and may not be able to handle all of the computers
that are trying to connect, so some of them get disconnected.
