GNOMEâ€™s help is being translated by a world-wide volunteer community.
You are welcome to participate.

There are $link[>>https://l10n.gnome.org/module/gnome-user-docs/](many
languages) for which translations are still needed.

To start translating, you will need to
$link[>>https://l10n.gnome.org/register/](create an account) and join
the $link[>>https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/](translation team) for your
language. This will give you the ability to upload new translations.

You can chat with GNOME translators by joining the #i18n channel on the
$link[>help-irc](GNOME IRC server). People on the channel are located
worldwide, so you may not get an immediate response as a result of
timezone differences.

Alternatively, you can contact the Internationalization Team using their
$link[>>http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-i18n](mailing list).
