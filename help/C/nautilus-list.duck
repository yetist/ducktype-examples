@desc Control what information is displayed in columns in list view.

There are eleven columns of information that you can display in the
$gui(Files) list view. Click $gui(Files) in the top bar, pick
$gui(Preferences) and choose the $gui(List Columns) tab to select
which columns will be visible.

[note .tip]
  Use the $gui(Move Up) and $gui(Move Down) buttons to choose the
  order in which the selected columns will appear. Click $gui(Reset
  to Default) to undo any changes and return to the default columns.

[terms]

- $gui(Name)
* The name of folders and files.

  [note .tip]
    The $gui(Name) column cannot be hidden.

- $gui(Size)
* The size of a folder is given as the number of items contained in
  the folder. The size of a file is given as bytes, KB, or MB.

- $gui(Type)
* Displayed as folder, or file type such as PDF document, JPEG image,
  MP3 audio, and more.

- $gui(Modified)
* Gives the date of the last time the file was modified.

- $gui(Owner)
* The name of the user the folder or file is owned by.

- $gui(Group)
* The group the file is owned by. Each user is normally in their own
  group, but it is possible to have many users in one group. For example,
  a department may have their own group in a work environment.

- $gui(Permissions)
* Displays the file access permissions. For example, $gui(drwxrw-r--)

  * The first character is the file type. $gui(-) means regular
    file and $gui(d) means directory (folder). In rare cases, other
    characters can also be shown.

  * The next three characters $gui(rwx) specify permissions for
    the user who owns the file.

  * The next three $gui(rw-) specify permissions for all members
    of the group that owns the file.

  * The last three characters in the column $gui(r--) specify
    permissions for all other users on the system.

  Each permission has the following meanings:

  * $gui(r): readable, meaning that you can open the file or folder

  * $gui(w): writable, meaning that you can save changes to it

  * $gui(x): executable, meaning that you can run it if it is a
    program or script file, or you can access subfolders and files
    if it is a folder

  * $gui(-): permission not set

- $gui(MIME Type)
* Displays the MIME type of the item.

- $gui(Location)
* The path to the location of the file.

- $gui(Modified â€” Time)
* Gives the date and time of the last time the file was modified.

- $gui(Accessed)
* Gives the date or time of the last time the file was modified.
