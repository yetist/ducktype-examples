@desc To set up most wired network connections, all you need to do
      is plug in a network cable.

To set up most wired network connections, all you need to do is plug in a
 network cable. The wired network icon
($media[its:translate=no src=figures/network-wired-symbolic.svg]($span[
its:translate=yes](settings))) is displayed on the top bar with three dots
while the connection is being established. The dots disappear when you are
connected.

If this does not happen, you should first of all make sure that your
network cable is plugged in. One end of the cable should be plugged into the
rectangular Ethernet (network) port on your computer, and the other end
should be plugged into a switch, router, network wall socket or similar
(depending on the network setup you have). Sometimes, a light beside the
Ethernet port will indicate that it is plugged in and active.

[note]
  You canâ€™t plug one computer directly into another one with a network
  cable (at least, not without some extra setting-up). To connect two
  computers, you should plug them both into a network hub, router or
  switch.

If you are still not connected, your network may not support automatic
setup (DHCP). In this case you will have to $link[>net-manual](configure
it manually).
