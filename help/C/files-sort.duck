@desc Arrange files by name, size, type, or when they were changed.

[comment]
  May benefit from figures illustrating the different views.

You can sort files in different ways in a folder, for example by sorting them
in order of date or file size. See $link[>#ways] below for a list of
common ways to sort files. See $link[>nautilus-views] for information on
how to change the default sort order.

The way that you can sort files depends on the $em(folder view) that you
are using. You can change the current view using the list or icon buttons in the
toolbar.


== Icon view
   [#icon-view]

To sort files in a different order, click the view options button in the
[-] FIXME: Get a tooltip added for "View options"
toolbar and choose $gui(By Name), $gui(By Size), $gui(By
Type), $gui(By Modification Date), or $gui(By Access
Date).

As an example, if you select $gui(By Name), the files will be sorted
by their names, in alphabetical order. See $link[>#ways] for other
options.

You can sort in the reverse order by selecting $gui(Reversed Order)
from the menu.


== List view
   [#list-view]

To sort files in a different order, click one of the column headings in
the file manager. For example, click $gui(Type) to sort by file type.
Click the column heading again to sort in the reverse order.

In list view, you can show columns with more attributes and sort on those
columns. Click the view options button in the toolbar, pick $gui(Visible
[-] FIXME: Get a tooltip added for "View options"
Columnsâ€¦) and select the columns that you want to be visible. You will
then be able to sort by those columns. See $link[>nautilus-list] for
descriptions of available columns.


== Ways of sorting files
   [#ways]

[terms]
- Name
* Sorts alphabetically by the name of the file.

- Size
* Sorts by the size of the file (how much disk space it takes up). Sorts
  from smallest to largest by default.

- Type
* Sorts alphabetically by the file type. Files of the same type are
  grouped together, then sorted by name.

- Last Modified
* Sorts by the date and time that a file was last changed. Sorts from
  oldest to newest by default.

[comment]
Mention that it is possible to reverse the sort order with the $gui(Reverse
Order) option.
