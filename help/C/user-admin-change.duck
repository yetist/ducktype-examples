@desc You can allow users to make changes to the system by giving them
      administrative privileges.

Administrative privileges are a way of deciding who can make changes to
important parts of the system. You can change which users have administrative
privileges and which ones do not. They are a good way of keeping your system
secure and preventing potentially damaging unauthorized changes.

You need $link[>user-admin-explain](administrator privileges)
to change account types.

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Users).

* Click $gui(Users) to open the panel.

* Press $gui[.button](Unlock) in the top right corner and
  type in your password when prompted.

* Select the user whose privileges you want to change.

* Click the label $gui(Standard) next to $gui(Account Type)
  and select $gui(Administrator).

* The userâ€™s privileges will be changed when they next log in.

[note]
  The first user account on the system is usually the one that has
  administrator privileges. This is the user account that was created when
  you first installed the system.

  It is unwise to have too many users with $gui(Administrator)
  privileges on one system.
