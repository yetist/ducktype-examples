@desc Your computer will work, but you might need a different power
      cable or a travel adapter.

Different countries use power supplies at different voltages (usually 110V
or 220-240V) and AC frequencies (usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz). Your computer should
work with a power supply in a different country as long as you have
an appropriate power adapter. You may also need to flip a switch.

If you have a laptop, all you should need to do is get the right plug for
your power adapter. Some laptops come packaged with more than one plug for
their adapter, so you may already have the right one. If not, plugging your
existing one into a standard travel adapter will suffice.

If you have a desktop computer, you can also get a cable with a different
plug, or use a travel adapter. In this case, however, you may need to change
the voltage switch on the computer’s power supply, if there is one. Many
computers do not have a switch like this, and will happily work with either
voltage. Look at the back of the computer and find the socket that the power
cable plugs into. Somewhere nearby, there may be a small switch marked “110V”
or “230V” (for example). Switch it if you need to.

[note .warning]
  Be careful when changing power cables or using travel adapters. Switch
  everything off first if you can.
