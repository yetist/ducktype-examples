The default color profile used for each monitor is generated
automatically based on the display 
$link[>>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data](
EDID) which is stored in a memory chip inside the monitor.
The EDID only gives us a snapshot of the available colors the monitor
was capable of displaying when it was manufactured, and does not
contain much other information for color correction.

    As the EDID cannot be updated, it has no expiry date.

[note .tip]
  Getting a profile from the monitor vendor or creating a profile
  yourself would lead to more accurate color correction.
