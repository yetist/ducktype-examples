@desc General tips to keep in mind when using the internet.

A possible reason for why you are using Linux is the robust security that
it is known for. One reason that Linux is relatively safe from malware and
viruses is due to the lower number of people who use it. Viruses are targeted
at popular operating systems, like Windows, that have an extremely large user
base. Linux is also very secure due to its open source nature, which allows
experts to modify and enhance the security features included with each
distribution.

Despite the measures taken to ensure that your installation of Linux is
secure, there are always vulnerabilities. As an average user on the internet
you can still be susceptible to:

* Phishing Scams (websites and emails that try to obtain sensitive
      information through deception)

* $link[>net-email-virus](Forwarding malicious emails)

* $link[>net-antivirus](Applications with malicious intent (viruses))

* $link[>net-wireless-wepwpa](Unauthorized remote/local network access)

To stay safe online, keep in mind the following tips:

* Be wary of emails, attachments, or links that were sent from people
  you do not know.

* If a websiteâ€™s offer is too good to be true, or asks for sensitive
  information that seems unnecessary, then think twice about what
  information you are submitting and the potential consequences if that
  information is compromised by identity thieves or other criminals.

* Be careful in providing $link[>user-admin-explain](root level permissions)
  to any application, especially ones that you have not used before or which
  are not well-known. Providing anyone or anything with root level permissions
  puts your computer at high risk to exploitation.

* Make sure you are only running necessary remote-access services. Having SSH
  or VNC running can be useful, but also leaves your computer open to intrusion
  if not secured properly. Consider using a $link[>net-firewall-on-off](firewall)
  to help protect your computer from intrusion.
