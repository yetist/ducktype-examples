@desc Calibrating your scanner is important to capture accurate colors.

  We should explain what a colour chart/calibration target is.

If you want your scanner to represent the color accurately in scans, you
should calibrate it.

[steps]
* Make sure your scanner is connected to your computer with a cable or
  over the network.

* Scan your calibration target and save it as an uncompressed TIFF file.

* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Color).

* Click on $gui(Color) to open the panel and select your scanner.

* Press $gui[.button](Calibrateâ€¦) to commence the calibration.

[note .tip]
Scanner devices are incredibly stable over time and temperature, so do
not usually need to be recalibrated.
