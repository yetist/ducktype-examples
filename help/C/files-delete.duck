@desc Remove files or folders you no longer need.

If you do not want a file or folder any more, you can delete it. When you
delete an item it is moved to the $gui(Trash) folder, where it is stored
until you empty the trash. You can $link[>files-recover](restore
items) in the $gui(Trash) folder to their original location if you
decide you need them, or if they were accidentally deleted.

[steps]
. To send a file to the trash:

* Select the item you want to place in the trash by clicking it once.

* Press $key(Delete) on your keyboard. Alternatively, drag the
  item to the $gui(Trash) in the sidebar.

The file will be moved to the trash, and youâ€™ll be presented with an
option to $gui(Undo) the deletion. The $gui(Undo) button will appear
for a few seconds. If you select $gui(Undo), the file will be restored
to its original location.

To delete files permanently, and free up disk space on your computer, you
need to empty the trash. To empty the trash, right-click $gui(Trash) in
the sidebar and select $gui(Empty Trash).


== Permanently delete a file
   [#permanent]

You can immediately delete a file permanently, without having to send it
to the trash first.

[steps]
. To permanently delete a file:

* Select the item you want to delete.

* Press and hold the $key(Shift) key, then press the
  $key(Delete) key on your keyboard.

* Because you cannot undo this, you will be asked to confirm that
  you want to delete the file or folder.

[note]
  Deleted files on a $link[>files#removable](removable device)
  may not be visible on other operating systems, such Windows or Mac
  OS. The files are still there, and will be available when you plug the device
  back into your computer.
