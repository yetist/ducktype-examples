  I know there were polkit policy changes. Not sure if this is 100% on the
  money for 3.2. Double-check when possible

If you can edit a network connection but other users on your computer
can’t, you may have set the connection to be $em(available to all users).
This makes it so that everyone on the computer can $em(connect) using
that connection.

  Anyone can edit the connection in 3.10.

  <p>The reason for this is that, since everyone is affected if the settings
  are changed, only highly-trusted (administrator) users should be allowed to
  modify the connection.</p>

  <p>If other users really need to be able to change the connection themselves,
  make it so the connection is <em>not</em> set to be available to everyone on
  the computer. This way, everyone will be able to manage their own connection
  settings rather than relying on one set of shared, system-wide settings for
  the connection.</p>
