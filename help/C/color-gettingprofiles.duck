The best way to get profiles is to generate them yourself, although
this does require some initial outlay.

Many manufacturers do try to provide color profiles for devices,
although sometimes they are wrapped up in $em(driver bundles)
which you may need to download, extract and then search for the
color profiles.

Some manufacturers do not provide accurate profiles for the hardware
and the profiles are best avoided.
A good clue is to download the profile, and if the creation date is
more than a year before the date you bought the device then itâ€™s
likely dummy data generated that is useless.

See $link[>color-why-calibrate] for information on why vendor-supplied
profiles are often worse than useless.
