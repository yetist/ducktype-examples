@desc The wireless could be turned off or broken, or you may be trying
      to connect to a hidden network.

There are a number of reasons why you might not be able to see your
wireless network on the list of available networks from the system menu.

* If no networks are shown in the list, your wireless hardware could be
  turned off, or it $link[>net-wireless-troubleshooting](may not be
  working properly). Make sure it is turned on.

Does anyone have lots of wireless networks to test this? Pretty sure it's no longer correct.

* If there are lots of wireless networks nearby, the network you are
    looking for might not be on the first page of the list. If this is the
    case, look at the bottom of the list for an arrow pointing towards the
    right and hover your mouse over it to display the rest of the wireless
    networks.

* You could be out of range of the network. Try moving closer to the wireless
  base station/router and see if the network appears in the list after a while.

* The list of wireless networks takes time to update. If you have just turned
  on your computer or moved to a different location, wait for a minute or so
  and then check if the network has appeared in the list.

* The network could be hidden. You need to $link[>net-wireless-hidden](connect
  in a different way) if it is a hidden network.
