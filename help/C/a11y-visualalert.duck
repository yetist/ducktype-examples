@desc Enable visual alerts to flash the screen or window when an
      alert sound is played.

Your computer will play a simple alert sound for certain types of
messages and events. If you have a hard time hearing these sounds, you
can have either the entire screen or your current window visually flash
whenever the alert sound is played.

This can also be useful if youâ€™re in an environment where you need your
computer to be silent, such as in a library. See $link[>sound-alert]
to learn how to mute the alert sound, then enable visual alerts.

[steps]
* Open the $Activities; overview and start typing $gui(Universal Access).

* Click on $gui(Universal Access) to open the panel.

* Press $gui(Visual Alerts) in the $gui(Hearing) section.

* Switch $gui(Visual Alerts) to $gui(ON).

*  Select whether you want the entire screen or just your current window
   title to flash.

[note .tip]
  You can quickly turn visual alerts on and off by clicking the
  $link[>a11y-icon](accessibility icon) on the top bar and
  selecting $gui(Visual Alerts).
